Tippy is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Shoaib Rain

Time spent: about 2 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- background color added for better view and app name provided
- Slider added (non-functional at the moment)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
All the customization buttons and interface was bit overwhelming at first. This was my first interaction with Xcode and I think Xcode is very powerful.
Ofcourse, it was hard for the first time with all those buttons but those features are there to make our life easy. And with consistent usage, Iam I'll
get use to it.
I also had challenges dealing with constraints and aligning components.
